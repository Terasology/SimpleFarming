 * particular vine in the world.
 * <p>
 * To create a vine, use an item with a {@link SeedDefinitionComponent} that links to the desired
 * vine prefab.  The newly created vine will initially consist of a single {@link #stem} block.
 * Over time, the vine will grow to adjacent blocks (in a line; each stem block has at most two
 * other stem blocks adjacent to it) and produce {@link #bud} blocks adjacent to the stem.  Each bud
 * is a bush, defined by a {@link BushDefinitionComponent} on the {@code #bud} prefab, and can be
 * interacted with like any other bush in order to produce produce and seeds.
