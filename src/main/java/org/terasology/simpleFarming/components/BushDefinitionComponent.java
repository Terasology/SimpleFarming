 * managed at runtime.  See individual fields for more information on how they are used.
 * <p>
 * To create a bush, use an item with a {@link SeedDefinitionComponent} that links to the desired
 * bush prefab.  The newly created bush will then progress through its {@link #growthStages} over
 * time.  Once it reaches the last stage, it can be harvested (via the "use" action) to yield
 * {@link #produce} or destroyed to yield {@link #seed}s.
 * <p>
 * This component is also used to define vine "buds".  These behave similarly to bushes, but grow
 * off of vines.  See {@link VineDefinitionComponent} for more details.
